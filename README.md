# Family Chores Display

A Python-based project that uses an e-ink display and the Todoist API to track family chores. This project fetches tasks categorized by family members, highlights completed tasks, tracks weekly progress, and provides weather updatesâ€”all displayed on an e-ink screen.

## Features

- **Todoist Integration**:
  - Fetches tasks by section (e.g., "Mom," "Dad," "Kid 1").
  - Displays tasks due today or earlier (no future tasks).
  - Includes tasks with no due date.
  - Tracks completed tasks weekly with automatic reset on Monday.

- **Weather Information**:
  - Displays current weather using OpenWeatherMap or NWS API.

- **E-Ink Display**:
  - Uses a Waveshare e-ink screen (7.5" B/W/R) for a clean and power-efficient interface.
  - Includes a sleek layout with sections, task lists, and weekly progress.

- **Automatic Updates**:
  - Refreshes the display every 15 minutes.
